# Turkish Native

Write Turkish as Turkish. Do not preserve the sentence skeleton of English or another source language and merely replace its words with Turkish ones.

A sentence can be grammatically valid and still sound translated. Work from meaning, not source-language shape.

## Core test

Before keeping a sentence, ask:

> If I had received only this meaning, with no source-language wording, would I naturally build the Turkish sentence this way?

If not, rebuild it from the intended meaning.

## How to work

1. **Identify the job.** Determine audience, medium, register, and intended action. A landing-page hero, button label, legal notice, and API document need different Turkish.
2. **Extract the meaning.** Separate facts and required terminology from wording. Preserve names, numbers, claims, dates, links, commands, legal terms, identifiers, and product behavior.
3. **Fix structure before vocabulary.** Check clause structure, word order, case, references, verb choice, and collocations first.
4. **Rebuild instead of patching.** If the sentence is structurally foreign, rewrite it around its main meaning. Do not repair translationese one word at a time.
5. **Read it as Turkish.** A native reader should not need to reconstruct another language mentally.
6. **Check fidelity.** Do not invent, remove, strengthen, weaken, or generalize factual claims.
7. **Check restraint.** Do not rewrite natural Turkish merely because another phrasing is possible.

## Voice and register

Match a supplied writing sample or existing product voice. Preserve deliberate short sentences, colloquial expressions, terminology, humor, or formality when they fit the audience.

Do not turn natural Turkish into corporate Turkish. `Sen satışa bak.` can be better than a longer formal alternative. Do not force every English loanword into Turkish: `link`, `demo`, `dashboard`, `API`, `MCP`, and `commit` may be natural in technical or product contexts.

## What to return

- **Write mode:** return the finished Turkish text. Explain rules only when asked.
- **Review mode:** briefly identify important problems and give a revised version. For page reviews, `Bölüm | Mevcut | Önerilen` is often useful.
- **File mode:** change prose only unless instructed otherwise. Preserve code, commands, URLs, route names, placeholders, translation keys, variable names, frontmatter, and machine-readable structure.
- **Embedded mode:** when another agent invokes the skill, return only the requested final copy unless analysis is requested.

## Translation and localization

Preserve meaning, scope, and product terminology, but do not preserve source-language word order, clause boundaries, or part of speech unless Turkish naturally uses the same structure. A good translation may split or merge sentences, drop an explicit pronoun, turn a noun into a verb, or replace a source-language metaphor with a direct statement.

If the user asks for a literal, legal, or line-by-line translation, honor that fidelity while still using grammatical Turkish.

## Pattern references

This skill contains **51 Turkish-specific patterns**. Read the relevant bundled reference before rewriting; for broad copy review or translation, read all five.

- **1–10 Sentence architecture:** `references/01-sentence-architecture.md`
- **11–20 Verb choice and lexical fit:** `references/02-verb-and-lexical-fit.md`
- **21–30 Product, UI, and localization:** `references/03-product-ui-localization.md`
- **31–40 Marketing and model-written copy:** `references/04-marketing-model-copy.md`
- **41–51 Register, fidelity, and final checks:** `references/05-register-fidelity.md`

These are diagnostic rules, not search-and-replace rules. Context always wins.

## Non-negotiable checks

Before returning the text, verify that:

- meaning and factual scope are preserved,
- clause structure is Turkish rather than copied from another language,
- verbs fit their nouns and real actions,
- case suffixes and references are clear,
- product copy uses user language rather than database language,
- marketing copy does not repeat or inflate ordinary claims,
- legal, security, and technical text preserves precision,
- natural colloquial Turkish has not been “improved” into corporate prose,
- one repaired shape has not been copied onto every sentence, and no line repeats
  what another line on the same page already said,
- the result sounds native when read without the source.
